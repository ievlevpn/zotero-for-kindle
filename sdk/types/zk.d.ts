/**
 * Zotero for Kindle — plugin API v0.
 *
 * **v0 is unstable**: names and shapes may still change; every change is listed in the API
 * changelog. A plugin declares the version it was written for in `plugin.json` (`"api": 0`).
 *
 * A plugin is one ES module (`main.js`) run by the app on QuickJS-ng (ES2023). It is neither Node
 * nor a browser: there is no `require`, no `process`, no `window` or DOM. Rely on standard
 * ES2023 and on what this file declares: the one global `zk`, plus `console`, `setTimeout` /
 * `clearTimeout`, `URL`, `URLSearchParams`, `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` (only the members
 * declared below). Libraries bundled into `main.js` are fine if they need nothing else.
 *
 * Everything is plain data: items, notes and annotations are JSON-like objects, the same shape
 * wherever they come from (a query, an event, an action). Everything that touches the library,
 * the network or files is `async`, because plugins run on their own thread and the screen never
 * waits for them.
 *
 * The module is run once and stays loaded while the plugin is on, so module-level variables
 * last from one call to the next (but not across restarts: keep what must last in
 * {@link zk.storage}). Calls into the plugin (event handlers, the background task, actions) may
 * interleave at each `await`, as in any async JavaScript: a read-modify-write of storage that
 * awaits in between can lose another call's write, so do it with {@link zk.Storage.update},
 * which runs a plugin's updates strictly one after another.
 *
 * Each call has a time budget (event handlers 5 s, the background task 30 s, actions and a
 * screen's `onEvent` at least 30 s, a screen's `render` 1 s). It counts from when the call starts running: time queued behind other plugins' calls
 * doesn't count, and neither does time waiting for the user to answer a confirmation (code that
 * runs meanwhile does). A call that goes over is stopped (see {@link zk.LimitError}).
 *
 * What a plugin may do is declared in `plugin.json` under `"permissions"`. Calling something not
 * declared rejects (or throws) with a {@link zk.PermissionError} that names what to add. Each
 * member below says which permission it needs.
 *
 * @packageDocumentation
 *
 * @example
 * // main.ts — log every book finished on the Kindle (needs "library:read")
 * zk.on("bookFinished", ({ item }) => {
 *   console.log(`Finished ${item.title} (${item.year ?? "n.d."})`);
 * });
 */

/**
 * Writes to the plugin's log (Settings → Plugins → the plugin, and the terminal of the desktop
 * build). Arguments are joined with spaces; objects are shown as JSON. `warn` and `error` are
 * marked as such in the log. The one way to log: standard, with levels, and what bundled
 * libraries call. No permission.
 *
 * @example
 * console.log("filed", change.key, "into", collection.path.join(" / "));
 * console.warn("feed returned no entries", url);

/**
 * Runs `callback` after `ms` milliseconds, on the plugin thread. While the call that set it (an
 * event handler, the background task, an action) is still running, the callback counts against
 * that call's time budget; a timer firing after that call has finished runs as a call of its own,
 * with 5 seconds. Pending timers are dropped when the call that set them is stopped by a limit,
 * and when the plugin is turned off. Returns an id for {@link clearTimeout}. No permission.
 *
 * A delay under 100 ms (or none) is raised to 100 ms. A plugin may have at most 1000 timers
 * pending; one more throws a {@link zk.LimitError} `"timers"` (nothing is set).
 *
 * While the app is in the background (another Kindle app or the screensaver is up), a timer whose
 * call has ended doesn't fire: it waits and runs, late, when the app is back in front. Timers of a
 * call still running fire as usual.
 *
 * Quiet run time: outside calls the user caused and the background task, a plugin's code may run
 * at most 2 s in any minute (sync events, loading, and timers and continuations of calls that have
 * ended all count). Once that is used, a timer whose call has ended runs late, when the minute
 * allows — not failed, not counted. Polling with `setTimeout` works, but cheaply.
 *
 * @example
 * const pause = (ms: number) => new Promise<void>((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
 * for (const url of feeds) { await fetchFeed(url); await pause(500); } // be polite to the host

     * All of a plugin's storage writes — `set`, `delete` and `update` — go through one queue (the

     * update's `fn` starts only when the writes asked before it have finished, however calls

   * Home, shown when some plugin has a main screen; a dot on it when a plugin has a badge, see

   *
   * The header shows `title` and the plugin's name, and its back arrow always works: the plugin

   * tab) closes it: it renders no more, and an `onEvent` call already running finishes (the
   * `back` event comes after it), but the {@link zk.ui.open}, {@link zk.ui.close} and
   * {@link zk.ui.refresh} it asks for are dropped.
   *
   * Budgets: `render` 1 s (it is usually milliseconds; it may `await` quick reads such as
   * {@link zk.storage}); `onEvent` at least 30 s, like an action (user-caused: it may change
   * Zotero and ask for removals; time waiting for the user's answer doesn't count). While
   * `onEvent` runs the screen stays drawn; taps are queued in order, and after 1 s the app shows
   * "Working…". A tree over the caps (2,000 blocks, 256 KB of text) or an invalid one, a `render`
   * that throws or goes over its budget, shows "<Plugin> can't show this screen right now" with
   * Back, and counts as a failure. An error thrown by `onEvent` is shown as an action's is

  /**
   * Thrown (or rejected with) when the plugin goes over one of the app's limits; the message names
   * it. `time`, `memory` and `stack` stop the running handler or task; the fetch limits
   * (`responseSize`, `responseTime`, `fetches`) only fail that fetch.
   *
   * `time` is the call's budget: event handlers 5 s, the background task 30 s, actions and a
   * screen's `onEvent` at least 30 s, a screen's `render` 1 s. It counts from when the call starts running; time queued behind other plugins' calls
   * and time waiting for the user to answer a confirmation never count. `memory` is 32 MB for a
   * plugin, and 96 MB for all plugins together: a call whose allocation would pass either is
   * stopped.
   *
   * When a call is stopped, the work it started in the app (fetches, library reads, storage and
   * file operations, timers) is cancelled, and every promise of that work still pending rejects
   * with a `LimitError` — none is left pending forever. So {@link Storage.update}'s queue, or any
   * queue a plugin keeps itself, moves on to the next job instead of hanging. Changes to Zotero
   * already asked for stay asked for (each resolved at once); a removal still waiting for the
   * user's answer is withdrawn. Code that catches the `LimitError` can't start new work for the
   * stopped call: such calls reject at once with the same `LimitError`.
   *
   * After a limit stop that cut into running code (not just a call left waiting too long), the
   * plugin is restarted: `main.js` runs afresh in a new runtime, so module-level variables start
   * over. Keep anything that must survive in {@link zk.storage}. Every stop counts as a failure;
   * three failures in a row turn the plugin off.
   *
   * @example
   * try {
   *   const res = await zk.fetch(bigFeedUrl);
   * } catch (e) {
   *   if (e instanceof zk.LimitError && e.limit === "responseSize") console.log("feed too large");
   *   else throw e;
   * }
